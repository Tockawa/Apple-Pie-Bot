# Apple Pie Bot. 🥧

Hello! It's me, тоска. This is my first "take it serious" project that is open-source.

Apple Pie is a Discord bot with many functions, such as Moderation, RolePlay Commands (There's only a few of them, but everything counts, right?), Cryptocurrencies, League of Legends Commands, and many other commands for you to use and manage your server or have some fun with your members!


## Features  - 🤖

- Capable of retrieving Cryptocurrencies/Tokens prices.
- Capable of giving you information about someone's League Stats.
- Capable of helping you to manage your guild.
- DM Commands!
- Custom Prefix for each user (Default is an _ )
- Custom Language for each user (Supported now: English, Português do Brasil)
- Private Database.
- Server with plenty of RAM so that she can eat as many she wants. Heh.
- Many Others!

  
## Optimizations - 🚀

From [v12](https://github.com/The-Crow-pleb/Apple-Pie-Bot/tree/v12) to [v13](https://github.com/The-Crow-pleb/Apple-Pie-Bot/tree/Apple-Pie-v13) this bot has seem tons of optimizations, such as the way it uses it's functions, the APIs it uses, and generally, from v12 to v13 this bot is faster, more reliable and I'd say, "complete".

But still, the bot isn't finished yet, so expect more changes soon! 

Found any bugs/errors or better ways to help in the optimization? Feel free to open a pull request with details of the code you changed!
