# Apple Pie Bot. 🥧

Hello! It's me, тоска (yet again). This is my first "take it serious" project that is open-source.

Apple Pie is a Discord bot with many functions, such as Moderation, RolePlay Commands (There's only a few of them, but everything counts, right?), Cryptocurrencies, League of Legends Commands, and many other commands for you to use and manage your server or have some fun with your members!


## Features  - 🤖

- Capable of retrieving Cryptocurrencies/Tokens prices.
- Capable of giving you information about someone's League Stats.
- Capable of helping you to manage your guild.
- DM Commands!
- Encrypt your passwords with OpenPGP Keys!
- Custom Prefix for each user (Default is an _ )
- Custom Language for each user (Supported now: English, Português do Brasil)
- Private Database.
- Server with plenty of RAM so that she can eat as many she wants. Heh.
- Many Others!
(For now, most of them are unavaiable, didn't had enough time to rewrite most of them in Typescript.)

  
## Changes - 🚀

From [v13](https://github.com/The-Crow-pleb/Apple-Pie-Bot/tree/Apple-Pie-v13) This bot saw some optimazations, changed the handler (Was using my own, now this bot is using [WOKCommands](https://github.com/AlexzanderFlores/WOKCommands) as a handler, I changed some things myself on the package, nothing big though). There isn't much added to it yet, this is an work in progress.

But still, the bot might not be finished yet, but expect more changes soon! 

Found any bugs/errors or better ways to help in the optimization? Feel free to open a pull request, or an issue with details of the bug/error or code you changed!

## Roadmap - 🛣


- [ ] Finish the commands that are missing from v12/v13.

- [ ] Create a per-server economy. (Yes, every server with it's own economy.)

- [ ] Create a global economy using some kind of "point" to get more features and etc.

- [ ] Get more attention from other communities.

- [ ] Create a dashboard.

- [ ] Other things such as making more pies, I guess?

 ## Final words - 📖
 
 So, this bot has been abandoned by tocka, she didn't had enough time, nor the patience to continue working on this project, and with that said, me, Tockawa (no, not the same person, we both just love the word "tocka".) am the maintainer of this bot, as well as the host and if I dare to say so, owner (pls don't kill me if you read this) of Apple.
